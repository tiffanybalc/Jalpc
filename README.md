This is my personal website for professional and career purposes as an undergraduate student and has my resume. 
Since creating this website, I have switched career interests from management consulting to software engineering.
Several months after publishing this website and after taking a few computer science classes, I switched to a second major in Computer Science.

Now, I am pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Washington University in St. Louis.
I believe that I have a fresh perspective as I have a strategy background and see the world from a unique point of view.
