          <li> As an optimist, I believe that a small gesture can make the world a better place. I have organized projects that encourage those around me to be more aware of the world outside of day-to-day life. As an environmentalist, I have done extensive research to casually educate those around me about ways they can minimize their contribution to climate change. </li>
          <li> The university I attend in St. Louis, the heart of the Midwest, is entirely different from my home in Orange County. I am not afraid to take calculated risks to achieve my goals. I am a self-starter and work well with minimal to no supervision, which lends itself to more creativity when I collaborate. I have taught myself how to design websites from scratch using HTML and CSS, and the basics of coding in Java. Even though this is unconventional for a non-engineer, it has helped me prepare for future demands of a workplace that leans toward technological advances. </li>
          <li> I am interested in management consulting because I enjoy looking for ways in which people and businesses can improve themselves. I am seeking a consulting internship for next summer and look forward to expanding and applying my knowledge.# Describe yourself. </li>
