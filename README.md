This is my personal website for professional and career purposes as an undergraduate student and has my resume. 
Since creating this website, I have switched career interests from management consulting to software engineering.
Several months after publishing this website and after taking a few computer science classes, I switched to a second major in Computer Science.
Now, I am in the process of chaning from the Olin School of Business to the School of Engineering and Applied Science at Washington University in St. Louis.
I believe that I have a fresh perspective as I have a strategy background and did not always see the world from a developer point of view.
It was forked from an open source Github project, and served as a personal coding project for summer 2017 during college. 
I am working on updating this website to reflect my new career interests.
